# Flux SDK + React

This exercise uses the [Flux.io SDK](https://github.com/fluxio/flux-sdk-js) and the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) base files.

To access the project, download or clone this repo and run `npm start` to view in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Brief

Following the [Flux SDK tutorial](https://flux.gitbooks.io/flux-javascript-sdk/content/), build a React app that pulls data from a provided Flux model and displays the data in a 3D viewport.

## Current Status

The project currently only provides login functionality via an unstyled login button to access the app.
